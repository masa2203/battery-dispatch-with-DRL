GENERAL:
- Data stems from renewables.ninja, three files with data have been downloaded for weather, wind, and solar PV.
- For all files, same location (see below), same time span (2022), and same dataset (NASA's MERRA-2) have been used. 
- The files were manually combined into a single dataset (removing metadata, renaming electricity columns to pv_power and wind_power).
- Electricity data for Germany stems from SMARD and was copied into file after adjusting the time-series to UTC and converting the price to CAD/MWh.
- Demand curve was generated synthetically and is saved separately.

LOCATION:
- Lat 54.2, Lon 8.9
- Northern Germany, Schleswig Holstein, close to North Sea.
- Location was chosen due to high wind resources.
- Not ideal for solar -> same for most of Germany.

WEATHER:
- Take all available variables (filter later)

WIND:
- Selected wind turbine: Siemens SWT 2.3 101.
- Chosen because: 2MW class has been a popular choice for onshore turbines (a bit outdated).
- Hubheight is chosen to be 100m (based on similar projects in Ontario).
- Nameplate capacity is 2.3 MW, hence capacity field is set to 2300 kW.
- Capacity factor indicated by renewables.ninja is 55.2%.

SOLAR PV:
- keep default system loss of 0.1 (fraction)
- capacity of 1 kW
- no tracking of sun
- tilt angle: keep default of 35 degrees.
- azimuth: 180 degrees, hence southwards facing panels
- Capacity factor indicated by renewables.ninja is 14.1%.
- Note: 1 MW of PV requires roughly 4500 sqm

HEADERS:
- see raw-data files for legend on headers and units -> weather data not copied into main file for now.

SIZING:
- Assume one SWT 2.3, 1MW PV installed -> then avg. combined RE is 1.411 MW
- Try to match demand to have roughly same average values for RE production and demand -> 1.474 MW if factor of 4_500 is used.
